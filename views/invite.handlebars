                <h3>We cordially invite you to join us in remembering Dave Olson.</h3>
                <p>Dave was taken from us suddenly. We weren't permitted to hold a funural for him, due to a coronavirus outbreak. Instead, we would like to hold an outdoor activity that Dave enjoyed, playing golf.</p>
                <p>This fall, LeAnn and Jonny Olson are hosting a Golf Tournament at Hunter's Golf Club, in honor of Dave. There will be food, drinks and music. If you're not up for golf, we invite you to the gathering, which will be at Violi's restaurant, half of the inside is reserved, as well as the party tent outside by the 18th hole.</p>
                <p>For those of you unable to attend or needing to socially distance, we welcome you to go to this <a href="">link</a> to say a few words...</p>
